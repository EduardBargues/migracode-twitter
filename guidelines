----- TODAY -----

- simulate a "final project" situation
- Expose idea : Simplified version of Twitter
    · brainstorm : what is this app suppose to do?
    · Define an MVP (List main 5 features)
    · Brainstorm about database structure
    · Posible features:
        * AS A user
        I WANT to tweet
        SO I can share my thoughts
        
        * As a user
        I want to see my tweets in my profile
        So I can edit, delete them
        
        * As a user
        I want to Delete a tweet
        So I can forget about the stupid things I posted
        
        * As a user
        I want to edit a tweet
        So I can fix typos
        
        * As a user
        I want to be able to like a tweet
        so that Twitter can know what I like.
            - POST end point to create a like
            - GET end point to see tweeters a user likes/dislikes

        * As a user
        I want to be able to follow other users
        so I can get info from them (interesting tweets, notifications, ...)

        

        * Get tweets user might like based on hashtags
